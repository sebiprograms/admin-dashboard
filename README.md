# admin-dashboard

A admin dashboard created to practice my css display grid and flex skills. Also continued building understanding of html elements and inheritance. 

## goals

- [x] Use Flexbox & Grid for a responsive design 
- [x] Apply custom styling with vanilla css
- [x] Try something I wasn't familiar with (using svgs for customizable themes & grid)
